						<ul>
							<li>As many of the user pointed out that they have trouble understanding and using the lookup code, we would like to address the issue here. Since the implementation is not complete, some of the functionalities may not be up running. This is still prototype phase, things may change significantly. We want to give a overall view of how and what does our do rather than providing a fulling functinoal application. The database for using the lookup code has not yet being developed, thank you for your understanding and support. </li>
							<li> We have created another navigation system as part of our A/B tesing, and we are very pleased with the new design. We think that it will probably replace the current one, but we will finalize the implementation once the result came out.
							</li>
						</ul>

							<li> We've re-designed the log in page with lookup code just like the gradesource</li>

					<h4>Feb 19</h4>

					<h4>Feb 18</h4>
